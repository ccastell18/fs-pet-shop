# Synthesized

This project will be a synthesizer made out of HTML and Javascript.  I will also include a thermin.  It will all be based off of 
the Web Audio API that is built into the browser.  
The synthesizer will:
-have choices of waveforms
-have working volume lever
-have a lever to sweep through frequencies
-have different filters
-have an LFO to modulate the outgoing sound
All built within the browser.
I will also attach a thermin that will be based off of the movement of the mouse
I will try to attach an 13 key piano if I have time.
