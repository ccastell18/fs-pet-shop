// Write a function that takes a string and returns an object 
// with the vowels in that string as keys and their value is how many times 
// they occurred in the string. The counter function should not care about case.
// The keys in the object should all be lowercase.
// Ex: countVowels('aAbcdade') -> {a:3,e:1}

function countVowels(s) {
  //write solution here
