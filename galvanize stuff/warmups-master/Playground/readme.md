These are warmups that we use in g23 to read code and explore a particular concept. The idea is to execute the console.log lines see if you can anticipate the results that will show up in the console. We encourage playing with the inputs and outputs to deepen your understanding of the concept and identify concepts that are still fuzzy to you.

When working through the javascript examples, comment out all of the console.logs except the one(s) you are considering and see if you can anticipate what will happen and why.
