// You have to create a method "compoundArray" which should take as input 
// two int arrays of different length and return one int array with 
// numbers of both arrays shuffled one by one. 
// Example: 
// compoundArray([1,2,3,4,5,6],[9,8,7,6]) => [1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5,6];

function compoundArray() {
  //Your solution here
}
