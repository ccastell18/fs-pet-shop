# Truncate Warmup

## Installation

- Clone repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test` to run the tests

## Tasks

- Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument)
- Return the truncated string with a `...` ending.  Note that inserting the three dots to the end will add to the string length.
- However, if the given maximum string length num is less than or equal to 3, then the addition of the three dots does not add to the string length in determining the truncated string.
- Finally, there is an error in the last test you will need to fix before you can pass that test

## Tips

- Take a look at the tests to see your expected input and output. Looking at the tests is not cheating.
- There are a lot of ways to write this, your goal is to have readable code, not the shortest answer
